BRUTE:
Find all possible permutations. Sort them in lexicographically increasing order. 
Find the given permutation in the order and return the next permutation.

OPTIMAL:
If the array is sorted in decreasing order then we just reverse the array and return it.
Else there would be an index where arr[i] < arr[i + 1].
So we start from the second last element and move left to find the index where arr[i] < arr[i + 1].
This index is called the break point.
If there is no break point, this means the array is reverse sorted. So we reverse it and return.
Now we start from the last element and moving left, we find the first element just greater than element at break point.
We swap both of these and reverse the part of the array from next to break point to last element.
